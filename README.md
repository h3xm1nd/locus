# locus
This repository explores an alternative model for networked information systems,
based on stable location, explicit topology, and verifiable identity.

The current Internet is optimized for reachability and flexibility, not for safety,
legibility, or long-term trust. As a result, many forms of abuse (phishing, impersonation,
fraud) are not accidents but structural properties of the system.

Locus is an attempt to rethink these foundations by treating digital entities
as inhabitants of a structured space, rather than nodes in an unbounded hyperlink graph.

## Status

This project is in an early exploratory phase.
The repository currently contains design notes and conceptual sketches,
which are intended to evolve into executable code over time.
